SELECT timestamp '2012-08-31 01:00:00';

/*
We've chosen not to here, but if you like you could format the
timestamp like "2012-08-31 01:00:00 +00:00", assuming UTC.
Note that timestamp with time zone is a different type to
timestamp - when you're declaring it, you should use
TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE 2012-08-31 01:00:00 +00:00.
